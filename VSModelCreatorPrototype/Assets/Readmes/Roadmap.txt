 Tyrons Wants:

Milestone 1
- Work with radfast to see how much code can be referenced directly from VintageStoryLib.dll
- Grid, Compass - Done
- Left mouse, right mouse, scroll wheel
- Element tree
- Play Animations - Done (wow!)!


"Not quite, the plan for now is a minimum viable product: 
Open file, 
Play animations (no editing), 
Add/Resize/Rotate/Move/Remove boxes, 
Save file. 
After which we'll take a close look now how the editor will look like. I got way too many ideas myself to make the workflow of our modelers simpler as well"
